<h1><b>My Food</b></h1>
<p>The food I like most is <i>Jollof rice</i><br>Jollof rice. : A West African dish of rice cooked in a sauce of tomatoes and onions seasoned usually with garlic, thyme, hot pepper, and other spices and often accompanied by meat, fish, or vegetables.</p>
<p>I like Jollof rice most because of it's diverse mix of spices, combined with a mastery of heat control, that gives the dish its signature taste. The tangy tomatoes, the spicy peppers, and the aromatic blend of herbs all contribute to the delectable its taste<p/>

<!--- these are the pictures of the finished dish --->

<p>Jollof is smoky and spicy, with a hint of sweetness from the tomatoes. Thanks to the herbs and seasonings, it really does have multiple layers of flavor. The exact ingredients vary: Some people use seasoning cubes like Maggi or Knorr, while others omit bell peppers and use only tomatoes.<p/>
